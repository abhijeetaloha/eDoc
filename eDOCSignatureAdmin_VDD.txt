Fix Allow Login Again prompt not requiring proper credentials (HF2-T936)
- Revise AllowLoginAgain prompt logic to fix several issues:
  - Fix dismissing the prompt when nothing is entered.
  - Changed "Close" button to a red "Exit" button for clarity
  - Improves security by ending the backend session and making login logic occur in the middleware
- This isn't perfect and needs more development in a few areas, such as adding support for MFA and password resetting (though both are reported to the user as "not supported").
- **Testing Steps:**
  - Make sure the `AllowLoginAgain` setting is enabled in your `config.php` file as exemplified in `config_sample.php`
  - Login
  - Wait for the refresh-session prompt to show up (The default time before this shows up is 13 minutes)
    - Alternatively, if you want to speed up testing, you can trigger process by submitting `saveDocsAndLogOff();` (for package creation) or `saveTheSetUpTemplate();` (for template creation) in your web browser's JavaScript console when you reach the review screen.
  - If you have `AllowLoginAgain` enabled, a prompt with "Your session has expired, please login again" should show up.
  - Attempt to log in.
  - Submitting nothing should ask you to add credentials
  - If you submit correct credentials and your account is using MFA or it requires a password reset, a notice should come up explaining that this situation isn't supported and requesting you to "Please exit to login page and log in again".

- Testing steps:
  - To speed up the testing process, you can perform the following actions:
    - In eDSAdmin's code, edit `common/session.php:19` and replace the values for the following variables:
      ```js
      const SESSION_LIFE = 3 * MINUTE;
      const EXPIRE_REFRESH_BACKEND = 2 * MINUTE;
      const EXPIRE_REFRESH = 1 * MINUTE;
      ```
    - In your SQL database management software (such as MySQL Workbench), run the following script to forcefully expire the session, setting `@sid` to your current session id (which you can obtain by submitting `SID` in your web browser's JavaScript console):
      ```sql
      SET @sid = '7A8FC5B52B234E71BBB920AF34745004';
      SELECT * FROM scenter.active_session WHERE Session_ID = @sid;
      UPDATE scenter.active_session SET Last_Request = Last_Request - INTERVAL 15 MINUTE WHERE Session_ID = @sid;
      ```
  - Login
  - Test the refresh-session prompt display logic
    - Wait for the refresh-session prompt to show up (The default time before this shows up is 13 minutes unless you changed the code mentioned previously, which makes it 2 minutes)
    - If the backend session is expired by the time the prompt should show up, you should be logged out
  - Test the logic added for tabbing back into the webpage
    - Switch to another window/tab in the browser
    - By the time the session expires, going back to visit the browser window should log you out
